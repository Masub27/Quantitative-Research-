# Quantitative Research Design
* “Research design” refers to the approach for answering your fundamental research questions. If it is quantitatively based, research design will center on numerical data collection and analysis (Grand Canyon University Official Website, 2023).
* Quantitative research design is used to quantify attitudes, opinions, behavior and other defined variables and generalize results from a larger sample population by generating numerical data (Mohajan, 2020).

2. **Control and Manipulation: In experimental designs, researchers control and manipulate variables to establish cause-and-effect relationships. This involves identifying independent and dependent variables and ensuring that extraneous variables are controlled.**

3. **Validity and Reliability: Ensuring the study's validity (accuracy of the results) and reliability (consistency of the results) is crucial. This involves careful planning of the research process, including data collection and analysis methods.**

4. **Data Collection Methods**

# Sampling Methods
# Concept of Sampling
Sampling in quantitative research is the process of selecting a representative subset from a population to analyze characteristics. It ensures that the sample reflects the population, allowing researchers to draw valid conclusions about the broader group being studied (Rahman, 2022).

# Sample Size & Representativeness
* Select appropriate sampling method
* Determine an appropriate sample size
* Calculate a sample size 
* Consider practical constraints
# Practical Exercise (30 minutes)

1. Think about your research interest 
2. Formulate a Research title/ Research Question
3. Do some initial literature review (via AI, researchgate, google scholar) 
4. Make a/some possible Hypothesis
5. Identify a possible Research design in alignment with your research question
6. Think about a rationale /reason/argument  for choosing this research design  
7. Identify appropriate sampling technique 

**Use AI platforms for this step-by-step procedure, check feedback, rationalize and improve accordingly**
