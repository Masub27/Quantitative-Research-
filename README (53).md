# R Project Material for Training
Creating Prompt to write an R Example script reading CSV File
 
Claude Prompt: 

* I have an Rproject file which has as a parent folder called "R_project". In the folder as well exists a csv file called 2024_25_Quant_Example_Data_AI_Competency.csv

* Please write me an R script which loads the 2024_25_Quant_Example_Data_AI_Competency.csv into the R environment.

Output from Claude: 

I'll help you write an R script to load your CSV file. Since the file is in the same directory as your R project, we can use relative paths.

```r
# Load required packages
library(readr)  # For reading CSV files
library(here)   # For project-relative paths

# Set working directory to project root (not always necessary with RProject, but good practice)
setwd(here::here())

# Read the CSV file
ai_competency_data <- read_csv("2024_25_Quant_Example_Data_AI_Competency.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the data
head(ai_competency_data)

# Display basic information about the dataset
glimpse(ai_competency_data)

```

This script:
1. Loads necessary packages
2. Uses the `here` package to ensure reliable path handling within your R project
3. Reads the CSV file into a data frame called `ai_competency_data`
4. Includes commands to preview the data

Before running this script, make sure you have the required packages installed. If you don't, you can install them using:

```r
install.packages(c("readr", "here"))
```

Would you like me to add any additional data validation or processing steps to the script?

Output script: (R file you have to create)


# Load required packages
library(readr)  # For reading CSV files
library(here)   # For project-relative paths

# Set working directory to project root (not always necessary with RProject, but good practice)
setwd(here::here())

# Read the CSV file
ai_competency_data <- read_csv("2024_25_Quant_Example_Data_AI_Competency.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the data
head(ai_competency_data)

# Display basic information about the dataset
glimpse(ai_competency_data)
