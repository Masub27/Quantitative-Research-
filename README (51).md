# What is Research?
According to Grinnell (1993), “Research is a structured inquiry that utilises acceptable scientific methodology to solve problems and creates new knowledge that is generally applicable”. (as cited in Kumar, 2005, p. 23-24)

# Quantitative Research
“Quantitative research is the methodology to quantify attitudes, opinions, behaviors and other defined variables, allowing researchers to generalize results from a larger sample population through the generation of numerical data”. (Mohajan, 2020 p. 50)

Categorize the questions:

1. What is the average monthly stipend received by TVET students during internships?

2. Is there a significant difference in the employment rates of TVET graduates between urban and rural areas?

3. Does the number of practical hours completed in a TVET program predict the success rate of graduates in certification exams?

4. What percentage of TVET students in automotive programs pursue further studies after graduation?

5.Do TVET graduates in hospitality earn higher salaries than TVET graduates in construction fields?

6. Is there a relationship between the availability of career counseling in TVET institutions and the job placement rate of graduates?

# Literature Review 
“literature review provides background information, highlight the significance of the research being conducted, find the areas of controversy, identify gaps in existing knowledge, formulate new research questions or problems and inform the direction of future research”. (Hui, Kaur, Ray, Li, 2023, p-475)

# Hypothesis Formulation 
According to Binoy (2019) & Supino (2012), Hypothesis formulation in quantitative research involves creating testable statements that predict relationships between variables, utilizing deductive reasoning. It serves as a guide for research direction, sample selection, and statistical analysis, ultimately facilitating the discussion of findings and conclusions. (Binoy, 2019) (Supino, 2012).
