# Understanding Turnitin

# What is Turnitin?
Turnitin® is a tool that students and instructors can use to identify potential instances of plagiarism. When you submit your paper to Turnitin®, you will get a similarity report that should be reviewed carefully so you can make any needed revisions to your paper.  
(Writing Center UAGC, 2025)
# What Does Turnitin Do?
!?[](https://github.com/Masub27/Quantitative-Research-/blob/main/Research%20Question2.mp4?raw=true)

* Turnitin® highlights sentences or phrases that are similar to works or papers that have already been published, submitted, or found online. Similarity is not always the same as plagiarism. You might have something similar in your paper to what has been published, such as a direct quote, but this does not always mean that you have plagiarized. If you have put quotation marks around that direct quote, and you’ve cited it, you have not plagiarized. Items on your references list are also going to show up as similar, but because these are citations, these similarities do not equal plagiarism.
* If the highlighted area in your similarity report contains information or wording that you have obtained from a source, be sure you have properly summarized, paraphrased, or quoted that material and you have cited the source. If you do not cite outside sources, it is considered plagiarizing.
